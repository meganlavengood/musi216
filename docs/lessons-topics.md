* Musical topics are closely related to musical styles/genres. A style/genre becomes a topic when it is used in another context, alongside other styles/genres/topics, in order to evoke the various associations with that style.
* An example of a musical topic is the *military* topic, which may feature dotted rhythms, fanfare trumpets, and duple or quadruple meter. [Darth Vader’s theme, “The Imperial March,” invokes the martial topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bzWSJG93P8).
* Musical topics are commonly used to analyze Classical-era music but have also been fruitfully applied to film and video game music (VGM).
* A list of traditional Classical-era topics would include military, pastoral, hunt, Sturm und Drang, and others; for film and video game music, we might identify additional topics of magic, outer space, underwater, [soaring](https://mtosmt.org/issues/mto.19.25.2/mto.19.25.2.atkinson.html), and so on.

Topic theory in music is based on the idea that listeners can recognize various styles of music and associate them with other situations even when they are appearing in a new context. This is a very fruitful approach to analyzing film and video game music (VGM), but the concept was originally developed to address Classical music.

Topic theory is often easy to grasp intuitively, so we’ll begin by discussing a Classical topic that we will also find commonly in film and VGM; then, a brief overview of semiotics will explain the philosophy behind topic theory; finally, we’ll briefly list some additional well-established topics that appear in film and VGM and give some examples of topic analysis.

## The Military Topic

The military topic can be invoked through any combination of a number of musical features, listed below:

* Snare drum
* Brass instruments, especially the trumpet
* Dotted rhythms and/or triplet rhythms
* Melodies based on fanfares and field signals
* Janissary/”Turkish” instrumentation, including oboes, trumpets, and most importantly, heavy percussion including metallic instruments
* The march style, which itself is characterized by
	* duple or quadruple meter
	* wind instruments and percussion
	* moderate tempo

The military topic in music of course may support militaristic themes such as warfare and soldiers, but it can also represent chivalry, a general warrior mentality, or heroism.

Thorough explanations for how these characteristics came to represent the military topic can be found in Monelle (2006).

The military topic is reliably found in victory music, such as the Final Fantasy series’s victory fanfare. Listen for the prominent trumpets and snare drum, triplet rhythms, quadruple meter, and moderate tempo, clearly signifying the military topic.
