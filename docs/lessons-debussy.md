## Planing

* Harmonic planing is a kind of non-functional triadic harmony.
* Harmonic planing moves all voices in parallel motion, thus preserving the same exact voicing in successive chords. 
* Planing may involve triads, seventh chords **(a and b)**, or other harmonic shapes such as quartal/quintal harmony **(c)**. 
* Planing may occur in all voices **(a)** or only some of them **(b and c)**. 
* Planing should involve at least three voices to be recognizable.
* **Diatonic planing** is when all the chords fit into a diatonic collection. Chord quality will not be preserved throughout the passage; instead, the chord quality will change depending on what is diatonic to the key. This kind of planing tends to sound more cohesive with the surrounding music.
* **Chromatic planing** preserves the exact same chord quality throughout the passage, which necessitates the use of accidentals. A passage of chromatic planing will not fit into a single diatonic key. Chromatic planing has a more striking sound since it is not governed by a larger tonality.

## Quartal/quintal harmony

* Triadic harmonies are built by stacking thirds; quartal/quintal harmonies are built by stacking fourths or fifths, respectively. 
* Because fourths and fifths are inversions of each other, quartal and quintal harmonies sound similar (just as harmonies built with thirds and sixths do).
* Quartal/quintal harmony fits easily within diatonic and pentatonic collections, both of which are built with fifths.
